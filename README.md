# VisSIMP
### Visualization of Simulated Interactions between Membranes and Proteins
###*Made by Mostafa Mohammed, Taylor Rydahl, and Patrick Sullivan*
###*In collaboration with Dr. Anne Brown*
#### Created using [Processing](https://processing.org/)

** TODO: Link to final paper (included PDF in repository **

** TODO: tutorial and features of VisSIMP **

### Keyboard Shortcuts / Controls:
* O : select input file (.xvg)
* - : decrease number of bins for residue position
* + or = : increase number of bins for residue position
* P : save current view as 'VisSIMP.png' in
* Q or ESC : exit VisSIMP
* D : output input data to console.  
* M : load a new membrane image file.


### Input 
Input is a .xvg file. First column is residue number; second column is distance of residue.  Residues can be in any order currently, future work will use the input.  Columns can be seperated by tab or space.  See example:
